I need to compare each unit with the unit that comes after or before, but not both.
The easiest feels like comparing with the unit before, because then I can skip the first unit and store that in another variable.
And just keep going.

If the current unit reacts with the unit before it, they need to be invalidated and the list needs to be updated.
