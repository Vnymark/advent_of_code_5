I need to compare each unit with the unit that comes after or before, but not both.
The easiest feels like comparing with the unit before, because then I can skip the first unit and store that in another variable.
And just keep going.

If the current unit reacts with the unit before it, they need to be invalidated and the list needs to be updated.


Part 2:
I need to subtract all kinds of characters from the Polymer, one by one (both lowercase and uppercase at the same time).
Then I need to calculate the Polymer and count the lenght, save the lenght and which polymer I removed (just for fun).
